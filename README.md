# Youtube-Downloader
YouTube video, audio, and playlist downloader with pytube.
## Why I made this script?
Because of Google. I was using FDM to download videos from Youtube until Google came and caused the FDM team to drop this feature for unknown reasons (a real mystery indeed). Other similar apps and even online websites are there that can download youtube videos, you just have to be content with what they decided to give (or show) you until Google comes again to do its business with them.

Another reason is my need for a fast, easy to use with keyboard method to download videos from youtube and select all the parameters I want.
